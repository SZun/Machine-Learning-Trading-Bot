In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Baseline Algorithm

### Performance Conclusions

From 2015 through mid/late 2017 the strategy returns for the baseline algorithm performed the same as the actual returns. From mid/late 2017 through mid-2018 the strategy returns for the baseline algorithm performed worse than the actual returns. And from mid-2018 through 2021 the strategy returns of the baseline algorithm performed better than that of the actual returns. From this we can colclude that although the baseline algorithms strategy returns did perform better than that of the actual returns for almost three years, since the baseline algorithms strategy returns were worse or equal to that of the actual returns for the vast majority of the timeframe, that the baseline algorihtm did not perform well and instead has a lot of work to be done to improve it.
